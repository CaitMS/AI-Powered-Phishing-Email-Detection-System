    "## Introduction\n",
    "Phishing attacks are among the most prevalent forms of cyber threats, often relying on deceptive emails to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or clicking malicious links. Traditional rule-based systems for phishing detection struggle to adapt to the rapidly evolving language and structure of phishing emails. As a result, artificial intelligence (AI) methodsâ€”particularly machine learningâ€”have become essential tools for building more flexible and accurate detection systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we develop an AI-powered phishing email detection system that classifies emails as phishing or legitimate using natural language features and metadata. Our focus is on building a lightweight, interpretable prototype using the XGBoost classifier, a gradient boosting algorithm known for its performance and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a publicly available dataset from Kaggle that includes both phishing and legitimate emails with labeled examples. You can access the dataset here:\n",
    "[ðŸ”— Phishing Email Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "The project involves the following core components:\n",
    "*   Data cleaning and feature extraction from email content.\n",
    "*   Training and evaluation of an XGBoost classification model.\n",
    "*   Applying explainability techniques (e.g., SHAP) to interpret model predictions.\n",
    "*   Testing the model on real-world-like examples and documenting its strengths and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to create a simple, explainable, and effective prototype that could form the basis of a real-world email threat detection tool."
